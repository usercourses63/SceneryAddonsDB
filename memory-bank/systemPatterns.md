# System Patterns

This file documents recurring patterns and standards used in the project.
It is optional, but recommended to be updated as the project evolves.

## Coding Patterns

**API Architecture Patterns (Existing)**:
- RESTful API design with standard HTTP methods
- Controller-Service-Repository pattern implementation
- Background service pattern for automated processing
- SignalR hub pattern for real-time communication

**Planned Frontend Patterns**:
- Component-based React architecture
- Custom hooks for state management
- TypeScript interfaces for API contracts
- Responsive design patterns with Tailwind CSS

## Architectural Patterns

**Backend Architecture (Current)**:
- Layered architecture with clear separation of concerns

- Docker container pattern for database management

**Frontend Architecture (Planned)**:
- Single Page Application (SPA) pattern
- Component composition pattern
- State management with Context API
- API integration with typed HTTP client
- Progressive enhancement for mobile-first design

## Testing Patterns

**Backend Testing (Current)**:
- Unit testing with xUnit framework
- Integration testing for API endpoints
- Service layer testing with mocking

**Frontend Testing (Planned)**:
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- API integration testing with MSW
- End-to-end testing with Cypress
- Accessibility testing with axe-core
