## API Analysis Key Findings

### **Complete API Endpoint Inventory:**

**Addon Management (`/api/addons`)**:
- `GET /api/addons` - Advanced filtering, pagination, search, sorting
- `GET /api/addons/latest` - Latest addons with count limit
- `GET /api/addons/compatibility` - Compatibility lookup by filename
- `GET /api/addons/stats` - Basic addon statistics

**Download Management (`/api/downloads`)**:
- `POST /api/downloads/start` - Start download session with concurrency control
- `POST /api/downloads/addon/{id}` - Download specific addon
- `GET /api/downloads/sessions` - List all active sessions
- `GET /api/downloads/sessions/{id}/status` - Real-time session status
- `POST /api/downloads/sessions/{id}/pause` - Pause session
- `POST /api/downloads/sessions/{id}/cancel` - Cancel session
- `GET /api/downloads/stats` - Download statistics and metrics
- `GET /api/downloads/folders` - Downloaded files by compatibility

**System Monitoring (`/api/health`, `/api/reports`)**:
- `GET /api/health` - Simple health check
- `GET /api/reports/status` - Comprehensive system status
- `POST /api/reports/status/console` - Console status display

**Data Management (`/api/scraper`)**:
- `POST /api/scraper/refresh` - Manual scraping trigger (with auth)

**Real-time Updates (`/downloadProgressHub`)**:
- SignalR hub with session-based groups
- Progress updates, completion notifications
- Global statistics broadcasting

### **Technology Stack Confirmed:**
- **.NET 9** with ASP.NET Core Web API
- **MongoDB** with MongoDB.Entities ODM
- **SignalR** for real-time communication
- **MonoTorrent 3.0.2** for BitTorrent downloads
- **Background Services** for automated processing
- **Swagger/OpenAPI** with comprehensive documentation

### **Data Models Identified:**
- **Addon**: Core entity with FileName, Name, Compatibility, DateAdded
- **Download Models**: Session-based with progress tracking
- **Filtering**: Advanced search with compatibility, date range, text search
- **Pagination**: Configurable page sizes with comprehensive metadata

## Open Questions/Issues

### **UI Integration Questions (RESOLVED)**:
- ✅ Real-time capabilities: SignalR hub with session-based messaging
- ✅ Authentication/authorization: Token-based for scraper operations only
- ✅ API limitations: Well-defined validation and error handling
- ✅ Download management: Session-based with concurrent control (1-10)

### **UI Planning Questions (ACTIVE)**:
- What are the optimal user workflows for download management?
- How should the real-time progress updates be displayed?
- What's the best approach for handling large addon datasets?
- How should compatibility filtering be presented to users?

### **Technical Questions (ACTIVE)**:
- How should SignalR connection management be implemented?
- What's the optimal caching strategy for addon data?
- How should download session persistence be handled?
- What error recovery mechanisms are needed for downloads?

## Next Phase Priorities

1. **Component Architecture Design**
2. **User Workflow Mapping**
3. **Real-time Integration Strategy**
4. **State Management Planning**
5. **Responsive Design Specifications**
